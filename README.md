# Intro to Git
This repository is meant to be a gentle introduction to github.  We will work through the process of creating and cloning a repository, committing changes, forking and merging.  For more in depth commentary see STOR 390 (Moral Machine Learning) course notes. 

This ReadMe should serve as the elevator pitch and user manual for your repository.  Any other software packages or installations that are necessary to run the included code should be listed here.  Data sets should be mentioned and cross-referrenced here.  

Notice that there is a syntax of sorts to writing within this ReadMe.  We are using *Markdown* syntax which should be reminescent of RMarkdown.  We can offset sections with a #, *italicize* with **, **boldface** with ****, and create formlas with $x^2+y^2=z^2$

## Software

Our class will be using R for computation.
